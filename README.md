# kafka-javafx-learn
This repository is for the project for learning kafka and javaFX.
# Launch manual
1. Start kafka with zookeeper (you can use this official quickstart guide: https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart)
2. Start BE-microservice (spring-boot-kafka).
3. Start FE-javaFX client (javafx-kafka-client) with any open port in your system. Pass it using command line arguments to the 'main' method. Each client should have different port.
4. That's it!
